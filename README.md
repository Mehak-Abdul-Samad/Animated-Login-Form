# Glowing Animated Login Form
A stylish and responsive login form with a glowing border animation and smooth hover expansion effect.  
Built entirely with **HTML5** and **CSS3**, this form stays compact until the user hovers or focuses on it, then expands to reveal the username and password fields, login button, and additional links.

## Features
- **Glowing Gradient Animation** using `repeating-conic-gradient` and CSS variables.
- **Interactive Hover Effect** — form expands and reveals content only when hovered or focused.
- **Pure HTML & CSS** — no JavaScript required for main animation.
- **Responsive Design** — adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Accessible** — works with both mouse and keyboard navigation.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** — for semantic and structured markup.
- **CSS3** — for styling, transitions, and animations.
- **Font Awesome** — for icons.

## How It Works
1. Initially displays only the **SIGN IN** title with icons.
2. On hover or focus, the form expands vertically.
3. Input fields, the login button, and action links fade in smoothly.
4. The glowing border animation runs continuously for a neon effect.

## Customization
- Change glow colors in `style.css` under `.card::before` and `.card::after`.
- Adjust animation speed in the `@keyframes` rule.
- Modify form size by editing the `.card` height values.
